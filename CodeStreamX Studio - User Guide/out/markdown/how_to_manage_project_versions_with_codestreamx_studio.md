Learn how to manage project versions in CodeStreamX Studio using its integrated version control, including setup, committing changes, and tracking history. This guide simplifies collaboration and version tracking within the IDE, enhancing project organization and development efficiency.

Before managing project versions with CodeStreamX Studio, ensure the IDE is installed and you understand its Git integration. Basic knowledge of version control operations is essential. Have a project for version management and ensure a stable internet for remote repository access.

1.  Initialize Version Control: Launch CodeStreamX Studio, load your project, and select "Initialize Repository" from the "VCS" menu to start tracking your project with version control.

2.  Commit Changes: After updating your project, navigate to "VCS &gt; Commit Changes," enter a summary of the changes in the commit message, and click "Commit" to save the new state of your project.

3.  Review Commit History: To inspect the record of changes, go to "VCS &gt; Show History." This displays a log of all commits, showing the modifications, the contributors, and the timing for each.

4.  Branch for Feature Development: Use the version control system to create new branches. This method enables isolated development of features or fixes, keeping the main project stable.

    For detailed version control commands in CodeStreamX Studio, see [Version Control Commands in CodeStreamX Studio](version_control_commands_in_codestreamx_studio.md).


Executing these steps results in streamlined project version control within CodeStreamX Studio, enabling precise change tracking, efficient progress documentation, and isolated feature development through branching, thereby optimizing collaboration and project management.
