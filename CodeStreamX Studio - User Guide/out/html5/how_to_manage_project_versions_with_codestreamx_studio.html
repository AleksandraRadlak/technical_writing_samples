            <p class="p">Before managing project versions with CodeStreamX Studio, ensure the IDE is installed
                and you understand its Git integration. Basic knowledge of version control
                operations is essential. Have a project for version management and ensure a stable
                internet for remote repository access.</p>

                <span class="ph cmd">Initialize Version Control: Launch CodeStreamX Studio, load your project, and
                    select "Initialize Repository" from the "VCS" menu to start tracking your
                    project with version control.</span>
            </li><li class="li step stepexpand">
                <span class="ph cmd">Commit Changes: After updating your project, navigate to "VCS &gt; Commit
                    Changes," enter a summary of the changes in the commit message, and click
                    "Commit" to save the new state of your project.</span>

                <span class="ph cmd">Review Commit History: To inspect the record of changes, go to "VCS &gt; Show
                    History." This displays a log of all commits, showing the modifications, the
                    contributors, and the timing for each.</span>

                <span class="ph cmd">Branch for Feature Development: Use the version control system to create new
                    branches. This method enables isolated development of features or fixes, keeping
                    the main project stable.</span>
