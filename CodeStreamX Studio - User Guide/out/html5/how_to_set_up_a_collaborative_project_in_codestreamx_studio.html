            <p class="p">To set up a collaborative project, first ensure CodeStreamX Studio is installed and
                updated on your computer, and have an active account with a compatible version
                control system like Git. Familiarize yourself with basic version control operations
                and prepare a new software development project for collaboration in CodeStreamX
                Studio. Identify team members for collaboration, ensuring all have necessary access
                and a stable internet connection for project setup and management.</p>
