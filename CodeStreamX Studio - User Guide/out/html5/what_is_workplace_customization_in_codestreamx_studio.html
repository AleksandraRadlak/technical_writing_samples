        <p class="p">Workspace customization in CodeStreamX Studio is a process which involves tailoring the
            IDE settings and layout to match user preferences and needs. It covers adjusting panels
            like the code editor, file explorer, and console output for better access, choosing
            visual themes to ease eye strain and enhance readability, and setting up keyboard
            shortcuts for a more efficient workflow.</p>
