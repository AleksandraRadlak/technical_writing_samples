    <title>How to Manage Project Versions with CodeStreamX Studio</title>
    <shortdesc>Learn how to manage project versions in CodeStreamX Studio using its integrated
        version control, including setup, committing changes, and tracking history. This guide
        simplifies collaboration and version tracking within the IDE, enhancing project organization
        and development efficiency.</shortdesc>

        <prereq id="prereq_l4q_fcq_1bc">
            <p>Before managing project versions with CodeStreamX Studio, ensure the IDE is installed
                and you understand its Git integration. Basic knowledge of version control
                operations is essential. Have a project for version management and ensure a stable
                internet for remote repository access.</p>

        <steps>
            <step>
                <cmd>Initialize Version Control: Launch CodeStreamX Studio, load your project, and
                    select "Initialize Repository" from the "VCS" menu to start tracking your
                    project with version control.</cmd>
            </step>
            <step>
                <cmd>Commit Changes: After updating your project, navigate to "VCS > Commit
                    Changes," enter a summary of the changes in the commit message, and click
                    "Commit" to save the new state of your project.</cmd>
            </step>
            <step>
                <cmd>Review Commit History: To inspect the record of changes, go to "VCS > Show
                    History." This displays a log of all commits, showing the modifications, the
                    contributors, and the timing for each.</cmd>
            </step>
            <step>
                <cmd>Branch for Feature Development: Use the version control system to create new
                    branches. This method enables isolated development of features or fixes, keeping
                    the main project stable.</cmd>

            <p>Executing these steps results in streamlined project version control within
                CodeStreamX Studio, enabling precise change tracking, efficient progress
                documentation, and isolated feature development through branching, thereby
                optimizing collaboration and project management.</p>
