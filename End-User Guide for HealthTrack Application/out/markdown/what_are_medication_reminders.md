# What Are Medication Reminders? {#what_are_medication_reminders .concept}

Here you will learn what medication reminders are in HealthTrack.

In HealthTrack, medication reminders are a specialized feature designed to support users in adhering to their prescribed medication regimens.

By allowing users to input specific details about their medications—including names, dosages and intake schedules—HealthTrack generates personalized alerts that notify users when it's time to take each medication.

This customization extends to the type of notification received, whether it be visual, auditory, or via vibration, accommodating the user's preferences and lifestyle needs.
