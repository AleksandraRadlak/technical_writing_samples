Here you will learn how to log your medication intake, monitor adherence and generate reports for healthcare consultations.

For a clear record of your medication usage, remember to regularly update medication intake in the app.

1.  After receiving a medication reminder, open the app and go to "Medication Log".

2.  Tap on the medication name and select "Mark as Taken" or "Skip" if not taken.

3.  Add notes if necessary, especially if a dose was missed or delayed.

4.  Review your adherence over time in the "Reports" section and share with healthcare providers through the "Share" option.


By following these steps, you will gain insights into your medication adherence patterns, allowing for better health management and informed discussions with healthcare providers.

Linda uses HealthTrack to manage her complex medication schedule. After each reminder, she logs into the app to mark her medication as taken. Over a month, she reviews her adherence report in the app and notices she frequently misses her afternoon dose. Linda shares this report with her doctor, who helps her adjust the timing of her doses for better adherence.
