# How to Choose and Customize Notification Features {#how_to_choose_and_customize_notification_options_for_your_medication_reminders .task}

Here you will learn how to choose from a variety of notification features.

To properly customize your notification features, first you need to consider and determine your preferred notification type: visual or auditory.

1.  In "Settings", navigate to "Notification Preferences".

2.  Choose between visual \(banner, badge\) and auditory \(alarm, tone\) alerts.

3.  Toggle the vibration option to "On" if you wish to add a vibration alert along with your chosen auditory or visual notification.

4.  Adjust the volume and visual appearance settings as preferred and save.


Customized notifications will alert you about medication times in your chosen method, reducing the chance of missed doses.

Mike prefers visual notifications because he often keeps his phone on silent mode. He selects the banner notification option with a distinctive icon for his diabetes medication reminder. Now, whenever it's time to take his medication, a clear banner pops up on his phone's screen, ensuring he sees the reminder even if his phone is on silent.
