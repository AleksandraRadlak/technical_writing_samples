            intake and daily blood pressure readings in HealthTrack for several weeks, John receives
            a personalized insight. The app notices his blood pressure improves significantly on
            days he takes his medication before breakfast. HealthTrack suggests John adjust his
            medication timing to consistently take it before his morning meal for better control of
            his blood pressure.</section>
