        <section class="example" id="how_to_record_your_medication_usage_and_check_adherence__example_b2x_mnk_z1c">Linda uses HealthTrack to manage her complex medication
            schedule. After each reminder, she logs into the app to mark her medication as taken.
            Over a month, she reviews her adherence report in the app and notices she frequently
            misses her afternoon dose. Linda shares this report with her doctor, who helps her
            adjust the timing of her doses for better adherence.</section>
