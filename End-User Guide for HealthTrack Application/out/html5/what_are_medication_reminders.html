        <p class="p">In HealthTrack, Medication Reminders are a specialized feature designed to support users
            in adhering to their prescribed medication regimens. </p>
        <p class="p">By allowing users to input specific details about their medications—including names,
            dosages and intake schedules—HealthTrack generates personalized alerts that notify users
            when it's time to take each medication. </p>
        <p class="p">This customization extends to the type of notification received, whether it be visual,
            auditory, or via vibration, accommodating the user's preferences and lifestyle needs. </p>
